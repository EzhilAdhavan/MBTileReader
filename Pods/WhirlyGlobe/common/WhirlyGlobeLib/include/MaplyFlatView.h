/** The flat view implements a top down orthogonal projection
    which is prefect for doing a straight up 2D map.
    It thinks more like a window in that it's trying to
    display the full extents (as passed in) within a large window
    (also passed in) but only showing a smaller window within that.
    We presume the caller will move that smaller window around, thus
    changing our model and projection matrices.
