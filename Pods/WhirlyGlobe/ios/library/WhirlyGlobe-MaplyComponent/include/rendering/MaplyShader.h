/** 
    The shader is a direct interface to OpenGL ES 2.0 shader language.
    
    You can set your own shader programs in the toolkit!  Yeah, that's as complex as it sounds.
    
    The underyling toolkit makes a distinction between the name of the shader and the scene name.  The scene name is used as a way to replace the default shaders we use for triangles and lines.  This would let you replace the shaders you're already using with your own.  See the addShaderProgram: method in the MaplyBaseViewController.
    
    You can also add your own shader and hook it up to any features that can call out a specific shader, such as the MaplyQuadImageTilesLayer.
    
    When writing a new shader, go take a look at DefaultShaderPrograms.mm, particularly the vertexShaderTri and fragmentShaderTri.  The documentation here is for the uniforms and attributes the system is going to hook up for you.  All of these are optional, but obviously nothing much will happen if you don't use the vertices.
 
**Uniform Values**
 
These are uniform values provided to each shader, if requested.
 
 |uniform|type|description|
 |:------|:---|:----------|
 |u_mvpMatrix|mat4| The model/view/projection matrix.  Shaders typically run vertices through this. |
 |u_mvMatrix|mat4| The model/view matrix.  Less comonly used. |
 |u_mvNormalMatrix|mat4| The model/view matrix for normals.  A shader typically uses this when we want view dependent lighting. |
 |u_fade|float| Available in regular drawables, but not yet in big drawables (e.g. atlases).  This is intended to fade geometry in and out over time. |
 |u_interp|float| If we're doing multiple textures, this is how to interpolate them. |
 |u_numLights|int| The number of active lights to use. |
 |light[8]|directional_light| A data structure for each active light.  See the table below. |
 |material|material_properties| Material information used to calculate lighting.  See the table below. |
 |u_hasTexture|bool| True if there's a texture available to fetch data from. |
 |s_baseMapX|sampler2D| s_baseMap0, s_baseMap1 and so forth are references to texture data. |

**Material properties**
 
These are the fields for the material properties.
 
|field|type|description|
|:----|:---|:----------|
|ambient|vec4| The ambient value for the material.  Shaders typically multiply by this value when calculating ambient lighting. |
|diffuse|vec4| The diffuse value for the material.  Shaders typically multiply by this value when calculating diffuse lighting. |
|specular|vec4| Not currently used. |
|specular_exponent|float| Not currently used. |
 
**Light properties**

These are the fields for each individual light.
 
 |field|type|description|
 |:----|:---|:----------|
 |direction|vec3| The light's direction, used in diffuse lighting. |
 |halfplane|vec3| This would be used in specular lighting. |
 |ambient|vec4| The ambient value of the light. |
 |diffuse|vec4| The diffuse value of the light. |
 |specular|vec4| Not currently used. |
 |viewdepend|float| If greater than 0.0, the shader should run each normal through the u_mvNormalMatrix. |
 
**Attributes**
 
These are the per vertex attributes provided to each vertex shader.

 |field|type|description|
 |:----|:---|:----------|
 |a_position|vec3| The position in display space for a vertex.  Shaders typically multiply this by u_mvpMatrix. |
 |a_texCoord0|vec2| If textures are present, this is the texture coordinate for the first one. |
 |a_texCoord1|vec2| If two textures are present, this is the texture coordinate for the second. |
 |a_color|vec4| An RGBA color for the vertex. |
 |a_normal|vec3| A normal in display space.  This is used purely for lighting and often run through u_mvNormalMatrix. |
 |a_elev|float| An optional elevation value provided by the MaplyQuadImageTiles layer.  You can use it to do elevation dependent shading. |
